# MLMiniProject
A mini project submitted as part of the Machine Learning course

The main objective of this Mini Project is to build a model that can predict the heart disease occurrence, based on a combination of features (risk factors) describing the disease. Different machine learning classification techniques will be implemented and compared upon standard performance metric such as accuracy.

The dataset used for this study was taken from UCI machine learning repository, titled “Heart Disease Data Set”.
